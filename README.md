# React Complete Guide Challenge #2

This is a challenge for a udemy course I am currently taking.

## The tasks are as follows:

- Create an input field with a change listener which outputs the length in text below
  - (e.g. in a paragraph)
- Create a new component to validate if the text is long enough
  - Decide on a length (e.g. use 5 as a minimum length)
- Inside the validation component output either "text too short" or "text too long" depending on the input length
- Create a component to hold each character and style it as an inline-box
- Render a list of CharComponents where each one receives an item in the input field as a prop
- Create handler to remove the item from the input field onClick
